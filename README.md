## Experimental Evaluation
One other solution I decided to try was brought up in the lecture, which was to find a designated person to eat the cupcake then it follows in order from then on. However, the person being called at random can make it hard to get the designated person then moving on to the next person will take forever and be a waste of resources because the person is not allowed to eat it cupcake until it is his turn when it possible he could have been called a few times already. At that point, I knew the solution would be inefficient due to its randomness it would probably run at $O(n^2)$.
